# Informal reagent form framework immediate roadmap

## shadow-cljs
- [ ] move main library to shadow-cljs instead of figwheel
- [ ] move examples to shadow-cljs instead of figwheel

## Atoms vs re-frame
Currently form contents are stored inside a main clojure of reagent form-3 component
- [ ] make POC to store all forms contents and metadata in global atoms
- [ ] make POC to store all forms contents and metadata in re-frame
- [ ] document proc/cons of both solutions and choose one

# Future plans
### Make informal into a library and publish on clojars
### Improve documentation
### Provide different implementations ('raw html components', 'mui')
